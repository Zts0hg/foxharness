# Design Reviewer

## Language Preference

Read `.codexspec/config.yml`. Two independent language controls apply (each falls back to `language.output`, then English):

- **Interaction language** (`language.interaction`): language for all conversation with the user — questions, explanations, status messages, and `codexspec` CLI terminal output.
- **Document language** (`language.document`): language for generated artifact files (requirements/spec/plan/tasks).

Converse in the interaction language and author artifacts in the document language. Apply the project's translation standard to both: translate by meaning (not word-for-word), keep English for terms with no good native equivalent, and write as if originally in that language.

## User Input

`the text after the $codexspec:review-design skill mention`

## Review Authority

Resolve by explicit path, then current branch; never silently select the latest feature.

Read `requirements.md`, `spec.md`, `design.md`, the constitution, and only the repository files necessary to verify design claims.

If `requirements.md` is absent, use legacy spec-only mode and disclose that original-discussion fidelity cannot be verified.

Authority order:

1. Confirmed requirements
2. Specification
3. Constitution and verified repository facts
4. Design-level technical decisions
5. Applicable best practices

## Review Passes

### 1. Fidelity and Coverage

- Verify every `REQ`/`NFR` has design coverage.
- Verify each component, interface, data change, and design decision has `Covers:`.
- Detect omitted behavior, semantic changes, scope expansion, and design decisions that override confirmed trade-offs.
- Verify design-level assumptions remain labeled and do not become product requirements.

### 2. Feasibility and Internal Quality

Report evidence-backed defects such as:

- Referencing nonexistent modules, APIs, paths, or capabilities
- Contradictory component responsibilities or interfaces
- Missing design decisions that genuinely block planning
- Invalid data, compatibility, security, or interface assumptions
- Complexity that creates concrete risk without serving a confirmed requirement

Data models, API contracts, sequence diagrams, cross-cutting design sections, and explicit interfaces are required only when the feature or repository context makes them necessary.

### 3. Advisories

Put optional best practices in **Risk Advisories** or **Design Opportunities**. Include applicability, actual risk or benefit, and relationship to the user goal.

Advisories do not affect status, do not affect the score, and must not be auto-fixed.

## Finding Validation

Every defect must include:

- **Evidence**
- **Location**
- **Mismatch**
- **Impact**
- **Remediation**

Merge findings with the same root cause. Do not deduct the same root cause under alignment, architecture, and decision-record planning separately.

Reject findings that are only stylistic preference, generic best practice without applicability, or a demand to replace a confirmed trade-off.

Zero verified defects is a valid result.

## Severity, Status, and Compatibility Score

- Critical: blocks a correct or feasible implementation
- Warning: likely incorrect implementation or major rework
- Minor: localized verified defect
- Advisory: optional and non-scoring

Status:

- Critical present: `BLOCKED`
- Warning present without Critical: `NEEDS_REVISION`
- Minor only: `PASS_WITH_WARNINGS`
- No defects: `PASS`

Compatibility Score:

- No defects: `100`
- Minor only: `max(80, 100 - 3 × Minor)`
- Warning present: `max(50, 79 - 8 × (Warning - 1) - 3 × Minor)`
- Critical present: `max(0, 49 - 15 × (Critical - 1) - 8 × Warning - 3 × Minor)`

Advisory does not affect the score. There are no fixed deductions for omitted template sections.
