# Systematic Debugger

## Language Preference

Read `.codexspec/config.yml`. Two independent language controls apply (each falls back to `language.output`, then English):

- **Interaction language** (`language.interaction`): language for all conversation with the user — questions, explanations, status messages, and `codexspec` CLI terminal output.
- **Document language** (`language.document`): language for generated artifact files (requirements/spec/plan/tasks).

Converse in the interaction language and author artifacts in the document language. Apply the project's translation standard to both: translate by meaning (not word-for-word), keep English for terms with no good native equivalent, and write as if originally in that language.

## User Input

`$ARGUMENTS`

## Role and Iron Law

You debug a reported symptom to its **root cause** and apply exactly one verified fix.

**Iron Law: NO FIX BEFORE ROOT CAUSE.** You MUST NOT propose, apply, or even sketch a fix until Phase 1 has established what is actually wrong and why. Symptom patches — wrapping the error, silencing a failing assertion, retrying blindly — are failures, not fixes.

Red flags that mean STOP and return to Phase 1: "let me just try changing X", "add a try/except here", "it's probably the Y" — any edit attempted before the failure is reproduced and understood.

You leave **no persistent artifact**: no report file, no debug journal. Your output is the fix plus a concise root-cause explanation in the conversation. (Reusable, cross-feature lessons are captured separately by `/codexspec:distill`, never written here.)

## Symptom Intake

Take the symptom from `$ARGUMENTS` when provided — an error or stack trace, a failing-test id, a `file:line`, or a plain-language description — otherwise from error output already visible in this session.

When the symptom is too thin to act on, **reproduce-or-ask** before doing anything else:

- First attempt to reproduce it yourself: run the failing test, exercise the path, read the log or stack trace.
- If you still cannot reproduce it reliably, ask the user for exactly what is missing — reproduction steps, the precise input that triggers it, expected-vs-actual behavior, the verbatim error, and when it started.
- Do NOT propose a fix for an unreproduced symptom.

## Investigation Protocol

Work the phases in order. Phase 1 is a hard gate.

### Phase 1 — Root-Cause Investigation (hard gate)

- Read the error/failure carefully and completely; do not skim.
- Reproduce it consistently. A flaky or order-dependent failure must be made reliably reproducible before you continue.
- Check what changed recently — the diff, recent commits, configuration.
- Trace the data and control flow **backward** from the symptom to where the wrong state originates. Inspect enough callers, callees, and inputs to locate the true origin; it is often not where the error surfaces.
- **Exit criterion**: you can state, in one sentence, WHAT is wrong and WHY. Until then, no fix.

### Phase 2 — Pattern Analysis

- Find a working reference: a passing sibling test, an analogous code path, or an earlier good state.
- Compare the failing case against it and enumerate every material difference.
- Identify which difference actually explains the root cause.

### Phase 3 — Hypothesis & Verification

- Write down a single, specific hypothesis about the root cause.
- Test it minimally — change one variable at a time, and predict the outcome before observing it.
- Confirm or reject. If rejected, reformulate; do not stack untested guesses.

### Phase 4 — Fix

- Write a failing test first that captures the defect (a reproducing regression test) and observe it fail for the right reason. For a symptom with no natural unit test — a documentation or configuration defect, a production-log incident — construct the closest reproducing check instead.
- Apply a single, minimal fix that targets the root cause — not the symptom, and no "while I'm here" changes.
- Verify: the new test passes and no previously-passing test breaks.

### Architecture Gate (≥3 failed fixes)

If three fixes for the same problem have failed, STOP. Do not attempt a fourth blind fix. Repeated failure is evidence that the model of the problem — or the architecture — is wrong. Surface it: state what was tried, why each attempt failed, and what architectural question must be answered before continuing.

## Completion

- Report the root cause (one or two sentences), the fix applied, and the verification that shows it green.
- **When you were entered from another command** (for example, `implement-tasks` escalated into this discipline), do not end the session: hand control back and **resume that command** exactly where it left off, now with the defect resolved.
- If you could not reach a root cause, or you hit the Architecture Gate, say so plainly with the evidence. Never paper over it with a speculative fix.
